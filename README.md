## Multi-domain claim detection: a coreset and an external feature based approach for automated fact-checking

![alt text](https://github.com/PMG-t/ProjectPresentations/blob/master/Images/Multi-domain_claim_detection_-_a_coreset_and_an_external_feature_based_approach_for_automated_fact-checking.png?raw=true)

- **Course:** *Master thesis work*
- **Tools and techniques:** *Python, Tensorflow, Large Language Models (LLMs), strong text preprocessing techniques for feature extraction*
- **Description:** This study focuses on the initial phase of automated fact-checking, the claim detection task, with the aim of developing a model capable of effectively generalizing across different linguistic styles and thematic domains while maintaining a sustainable computational complexity. By exploiting the CheckThat! competition datasets published in the last five years, we propose a coreset-based approach to reduce the size of the datasets without compromising their representativeness. This approach allows combining information from different domains, creating a smaller but equally representative training dataset. The use of coresets then allows the adoption of more complex models, integrating not only the representations generated by Large Language Models (LLM), but also external features, such as key concept definitions and syntactic structures. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of coresets in maintaining the representativeness of the original data, reducing noise and allowing an average performance equivalent (or even better) than the one obtained with the full datasets. Furthermore, an increase in the average performance on different datasets is observed when the model incorporates external features, improving the claim detection capabilities compared to the exclusive use of LLM representations.

## Understanding semantic perception of cities in society

![alt text](https://github.com/PMG-t/ProjectPresentations/blob/master/Images/Understanding_semantic_perception_of_cities_in_society.png?raw=true)

- **Course:** *Data semantics*
- **Tools and techniques:** *Python, Word2Vec, strong text preprocessing techniques, Bokeh interactive visualization*
- **Worked on:** *Unsupervised apporaches for key-phrases extraction and graph visualization development*
- **Description:** This project uses a large corpus of texts from different sources to analyze and represent the perception of various cities around the world, focusing on the extraction of thematic keywords. Both supervised and unsupervised approaches are employed, using textual representations based on Word2Vec for the extraction of keyphrases. The city representations are linked based on the similarity of the terms and the context in which they are used, allowing for an in-depth comparison between the different perceptions. Finally, an interactive interface is developed to visualize the results, highlighting the most common meanings associated with each city, their number and their similarity to the perceptions of other cities. This approach offers a new way to explore urban narratives and global cultural interconnections.

## Unimib energy consumption descriptive and predictive analysis

![alt text](https://github.com/PMG-t/ProjectPresentations/blob/master/Images/Unimib_energy_consumption_descriptive_and_predictive_analysis.png?raw=true)

- **Course:** *Data science lab*
- **Tools and techniques:** *R Studio, time series forcasting models, Self-Organizing-Maps*
- **Worked on:** *Self-Organizing-Map to indetify different consumption behaviour patterns*
- **Description:** This study analyzes a time series related to the energy consumption of a building at the University of Bicocca, applying an autoregressive model for the forecasting of future consumption. To understand consumption variations, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used to observe the differences in consumption trends based on variables such as percentage consumption and the increasing or decreasing intensity of hourly consumption. The analysis also integrates external meteorological data, such as temperature and humidity, to evaluate their impact on energy consumption. This approach allows to distinguish different periods of the year in which consumption levels present similar or divergent patterns, highlighting critical moments and offering ideas for energy efficiency and sustainable management interventions.
